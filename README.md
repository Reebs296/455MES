# 455 MES

# Course Overview, Content, and Objectives
In this project-based course students will learn about factory-scale planning and control. Building on the
Level 0 (Field), Level 1 (Control), and Level 2 (Supervisory) foundation laid in previous courses, students
will design and implement a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) to satisfy Level 3 (Planning)
requirements. Students will work from functional specifications to create a detailed design of an MES.
Students will then build out the core features of an MES: production functions, communication layer,
databases, user interfaces, and data analytics. Once students have implemented the basic MES
framework they will work on adding additional functionality according to the MESA Model. Test
planning and analysis will be used to evaluate the overall system design.
The course consists of a conceptual part that introduces the fundamentals of factory planning and
system integration and a laboratory part where students gain experience on a lab-scale cyber-physical
(CP) manufacturing plant.

# Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, students should be able to:
• Understand the core features and added value of an MES
• Produce and execute test plans (TPS) and test analysis reports (TAR) for an MES
• Design and implement the core architecture of an MES
• Integrate various subsystems that constitute an MES, from the process level to database management to user interfaces to data analytics and visualization
• Work effectively in a team to accomplish a multi-faceted and complex objective
• Produce engineering design documentation detailing an MES design
• Reflect on an MES design and make objective conclusions and recommendations for improvement
